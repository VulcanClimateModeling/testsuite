# Introduction

The testsuite is an open-source framework for regression testing of atmospheric models written in Python. It has originally been written for the COSMO model (http://www.cosmo-model.org/) 
but has subsequently been generalized to work with other atmospheric models as well. Some adaptions to the models typically have to be done in order for the testsuite to work.

## Continuous Integration [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/VulcanClimateModeling/testsuite.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/VulcanClimateModeling/testsuite)

Testsuite builds are run on Travis CI [here](https://travis-ci.com/C2SM-RCM/testsuite).
